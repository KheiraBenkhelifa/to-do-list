📝 To-Do List – Front-End Project

This project is a responsive To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to add, delete, and manage tasks in a simple and intuitive interface.

Special attention was given to responsive design, ensuring that the task text and action buttons remain properly aligned on all screen sizes, including mobile devices.

This project helped me practice:

DOM manipulation with JavaScript

event handling

responsive layout using CSS Flexbox

basic front-end logic

👉 Project developed as part of my front-end development training.
